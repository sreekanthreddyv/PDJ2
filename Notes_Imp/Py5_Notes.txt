# The next time you run your program, Python will load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as you haven’t changed your source code since the byte code was last saved.

# That byte code is saved in files only for files that are imported, not for the top-level files of a program that are only run as scripts

# Python programs into true executables, known as frozen binaries in the Python world. These programs can be run without equiring a Python installation.

# An attribute is simply a variable name that is attached to a specific object (like a module).

Q) Why might you need to reload a module?

A) Python imports (loads) a module only once per process, by default, so if you’ve changed its source code and want to run the new version without stopping and restarting Python, you’ll have to reload it. You must import a module at least once before you can reload it.

Q) What is a namespace, and how does it relate to module files?

A) A namespace is just a package of variables (i.e., names). It takes the form of an object with attributes in Python. Each module file is automatically a namespace— that is, a package of variables reflecting the assignments made at the top level of the file. Namespaces help avoid name collisions in Python programs: because each module file is a self-contained namespace, files must explicitly import other files in order to use their names.

	$ B = bytearray(b'eggs')
	$ B.extend(b'spam')
	$ B.decode() # Translate to normal string

# repr('spam') >> # Used by echoes: as-code form
	"'spam'"
# str('spam')  >> # # Used by print: user-friendly form
	'spam'

# floor >> Closest number below value

# trunc >> Truncate fractional part (toward zero)

**** from fractions import Fraction ****
	x = Fraction(1, 3)
	y = Fraction(2, 3)

# Once created, Fraction s can be used in mathematical expressions as usual:

	$ x + y >>> Fraction(1, 1)

# Fraction objects can also be created from floating-point number strings.

	$ Fraction('0.25') >>> Fraction(1, 4)

# Moreover, fractions and decimals both allow more intuitive and accurate results than floating points sometimes can

# >>> x > y, x < y  >>> # Superset, subset
(False, False) 

# Sets can be used to isolate differences in lists, strings, and other iterable objects too—
# simply convert to sets and take the difference

>>> set([1, 3, 5, 7]) - set([1, 2, 4, 5, 6])  # Find list differences
{3, 7}

# You can also use sets to perform order-neutral equality tests by converting to a set before the test, because order doesn’t matter in a set.

>>> L1, L2 = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4], [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]
>>> L1 == L2  # Order matters in sequences
False

>>> set(L1) == set(L2) # Order-neutral equality
True

# engineers > managers # Are all managers engineers? (superset)

# These steps reflect the operation of all assignments in the Python language:
	1. Create an object to represent the value 3 .
	2. Create the variable a , if it does not yet exist.
	3. Link the variable a to the new object 3 .

	$ l1 = [2, 3, 4]
	$ l2 = l1
	$ l1[0] = 23
	$ l1 >>> [23, 3, 4]
	$ l2 >>> [23, 3, 4]

	$ l3 = l1[:] # Make a copy of L1 (or list(L1), copy.copy(L1), etc.

	# The change made through L1 is not reflected in L2 because L2 references a copy of the object L1 references, not the original; that is, the two variables point to different pieces of memory.

import copy
X = copy.copy(Y)  # Make top-level "shallow" copy of any object Y
X = copy.deepcopy(Y)  # Make deep copy of any object Y: copy all nested parts

>>> L = [1, 2, 3]
>>> M = L	# M and L reference the same object
>>> L == M	# Same Values
True
>>> L is M	# Same objects

****************

>>> L = [1, 2, 3]
>>> M = [1, 2, 3]# M and L refernce different objects
>>> L == M	# Same Values
True
>>> L is M	# Different objects
False


# The == operator, tests whether the two referenced objects have the same values;

# The is operator, instead tests for object identity—it returns True only if both names point to the exact same object

# The "getrefcount" function in the standard sys module returns the object’s reference count.

# There are three string types: 
	str is used for Unicode text (including ASCII),
	bytes is used for binary data (including encoded text),
	bytearray is a mutable variant of bytes .

*** Functions ***

# function is a device that groups a set of statements so they can be run more than once in a program.

# Two ways to make functions ( def and lambda )

# Two ways to manage scope and visibility ( global and nonlocal )

# Two ways to send results back to callers ( return and yield )

# global declares module-level variables that are to be assigned. By default, all names assigned in a function are local to that function and exist only while the function runs. To assign a name in the enclosing module, functions need to list it in a global statement.

# except E as X .Because they might defer garbage collection’s memory recovery,

# in 3.X, such variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!).

# In 2.X, these variables live on after the try statement.

# because the nonlocal statement (available in Python 3.X but not 2.X) means that the assignment to X inside the nested function changes X in the enclosing function’s local scope.

	def func(a, b, c):
		a=2
		b[0]='x'
		c['a'] = 'y'

	l=1; m=[1]; n={'a':0}

	func(l, m, n)

	print(l, m, n) # 1, [x], {'a':'y'}

# This displays (1, ['x'], {'a': 'y'}) —the first assignment in the function doesn’t impact the caller, but the second two do because they change passed-in mutable objects in place.

>>> sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default
1000

>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting

>>> func.__code__.co_varnames
('a', 'b')
>>> func.__code__.co_argcount
1

# lambda -> An expression form that generates function objects.

	$ lambda argument1, argument2,... argumentN : expression using arguments

# Unlike normal functions that return a value and exit, generator functions automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the point of value generation. (592)

# Generator functions
	A function def statement that contains a yield statement is turned into a generator function.

# Generator expressions
	A comprehension expression enclosed in parentheses is known as a generator expression.

# Import enclosing module, Qualify to get to global version of name

	x = 99
	def selector():
		import __main__
		print(__main__.x)
		x = 88
		print(x)

	selector()
	print(x)

# mutable default arguments retain their state between function calls,

	def saver(x=[]):
		x.append(1)
		print(x)

	saver() # [1] # grows on each call
	saver() # [1, 1]
	saver() # [1, 1, 1]

# Won't grow here

	def saver(x=None):
		if x is None: # x = x or []
			x = []
		x.append(1)
		print(x)

***** Modules & Packages *****

# import
	Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole

# from
	Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module

# imp.reload ( reload in 2.X)
	Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python

# As the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents.

# The top-level (a.k.a. script) file contains the main flow of control of your program—this is the file you run to launch your application.

	$ from small import x
	$ x = 7	# Changes x local only

# callable(<func name>)
	True

# hasattr(<func name>, '__call__')

# By default, a module is imported only once per process. The reload function forces a module to be imported again. It is mostly used to pick up new versions of a module’s source code during development, and in dynamic customization scenarios.

# A directory of Python code is said to be a package, so such imports are known as package imports. In effect, a package import turns a directory on your computer into another Python namespace, with attributes corresponding to the subdirectories and module files that the directory contains.

# Data Hiding in Modules
	
	# unders.py
	$ a, _b, c, _d = 1, 2, 3, 4

	$ from unders import *
	_b
	NameError: name '_b' is not defined

	$ import unders
	unders._b >> 2

# Alternatively, you can achieve a hiding effect similar to the _X naming convention by assigning a list of variable name strings to the variable __all__ at the top level of the module.

# When this feature is used, the from * statement will copy out only those names listed in the __all__ list.

	# alls.py
	__all__ = ['a', '_c']

	a, b, _c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4

# The __all__ list has meaning only to the from * statement form and does not amount to a privacy declaration: other import statements can still access all names.

	import alls
	alls.a, alls.b, alls._c

# __name__ and __main__

	if __name__ == '__main__':	# Only when run
		tester()				# Not when imported

	modname = 'string'
	>>> exec('import ' + modname)	# Run a string of code

# Direct Calls: Two Options

	$ fun = __import__('module')

	$ import importlib
	$ fun = importlib.import_module('module')

# Code inside a function body doesn’t run until the function is called; because names in a function aren’t resolved until the function actually runs,

# If a module’s __name__ variable is the string "__main__" , it means that the file is being executed as a top-level script instead of being imported from another file in the program. That is, the file is being used as a program, not a library. This usage mode variable supports dual-mode code and tests.

# instance.__class__

# instance.__class__.__name__

# To use slots, assign a sequence of string names to the special __slots__ variable and attribute at the top level of a class statement: only those names in the __slots__ list can be assigned as instance attributes.

# Bullet 1: slots in sub but not super
# Makes instance dict for nonslots
# But slot name still managed in class

# Bullet 2: slots in super but not sub
# Makes instance dict for nonslots
# But slot name still managed in class

$ class C: __slots__ = ['a']; a = 99 # Bullet 4: no class-level defaults

# ValueError: 'a' in __slots__ conflicts with class variable (py3 only)
